# Grug Archive: Experiments and Snapshots

This file is the paper trail for grug experiments.

## Principles

- `experiments/grug/base/` is the canonical template.
- Speedrun files are exploratory and may be deleted after upstreaming.
- Prefer deletion over long-term maintenance of stale experiment code.
