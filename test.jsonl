{"problem": "How do you factor 4y² -13y -12? May 30, 2015\n\nUse a version of the AC Method. A = 4, B = 13, C = 12. Look for a pair of factors of AC = 48 whose difference is B = 13. 16 and 3 work. Use this pair to split the middle term then factor by grouping:\n\n4y² - 13y - 12 = 4y² + 3y - 16y - 12\n= (4y² + 3y) - (16y + 12)\n= y(4y + 3) - 4(4y + 3)\n= (y - 4)(4y + 3)"}
{"problem": "Thread: Question involving a continuous function on a closed interval\n\n## Question involving a continuous function on a closed interval\n\nIntuitively, this is obvious by graphing g(x) = x on [0,1] and seeing that since f is continuous, it has to intersect with g at some point. But I spent a long time and cannot figure out how to prove this.\n\nIt is the well-known fixed point theorem. Suppose f is continuous on [0,1] and f(x) ∈ [0,1] for every x ∈ [0,1]. If f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 1, the theorem is proved. So we try to prove the theorem assuming f(0) > 0 and f(1) < 1. Let g(x) = f(x) - x for all x ∈ [0,1]. Hence g(0) > 0 and g(1) < 0 and g is continuous on [0,1], that is, 0 is an intermediate value of g on [0,1]. Hence by the intermediate value theorem, there exists a point c ∈ (0,1) such that g(c) = 0, which means f(c) = c. Hence the proof.\n\nEDIT: c is equivalent to x₀.\n\nOriginally Posted by paulrb:\nIntuitively, this is obvious by graphing g(x) = x on [0,1] and seeing that since f is continuous, it has to intersect with g at some point.

{"problem": "Equation solver with square root\n\nThis equation solver with square root supplies step-by-step instructions for solving all math troubles. Our website will give you answers to homework.\n\n## The Best Equation Solver with Square Root\n\nIn this blog post, we will be discussing the equation solver with square root. As any math student knows, calculus can be a difficult subject to grasp. The concepts are often complex and require a great deal of concentration to understand. Fortunately, there are now many calculus solvers available that can help to make the subject more manageable. These tools allow you to input an equation and see the steps involved in solving it. This can be a great way to learn how to solve problems on your own.\n\nIn addition, calculus solvers with steps can also help you to check your work and ensure that you are getting the correct answer. With so many helpful features, it is no wonder that these tools are becoming increasingly popular among math students of all levels.\n\nWord phrase math is a mathematical technique that uses words instead of symbols to represent numbers and operations. This approach can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with traditional math notation. By using words, students can more easily visualize the relationships between numbers and operations. As a result, word phrase math can provide a valuable tool for understanding complex mathematical concepts. Additionally, this technique can also be used to teach basic math skills to young children. By representing numbers and operations with familiar words, children can develop a strong foundation for future mathematics learning.\n\nA rational function is any function that can be expressed as the quotient of two polynomials. In other words, it is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are both polynomials. The simplest example of a rational function is a linear function, which has the form f(x) = mx + b. More generally, a rational function can have any degree; that is, the highest power of x in the numerator and denominator can be any number.\n\nTo solve a rational function, we must first determine its roots. A root is a value of x for which the numerator equals zero. Therefore, to solve a rational function, we set the numerator equal to zero and solve for x. Once we have determined the roots of the function, we can use them to find its asymptotes. An asymptote is a line that the graph of the function approaches but never crosses. A rational function can have horizontal, vertical, or slant asymptotes, depending on its roots. To find a horizontal asymptote, we take the limit of the function as x approaches infinity; that is, we let x get very large and see what happens to the value of the function. Similarly, to find a vertical asymptote, we take the limit of the function as x approaches zero. Finally, to find a slant asymptote, we take the limit of the function as x approaches one of its roots. Once we have determined all these features of the graph, we can sketch it on a coordinate plane.\n\nA binomial solver is a math tool that helps solve equations with two terms. This type of equation is also known as a quadratic equation. The solver will usually ask for the coefficients of the equation, which are the numbers in front of the x terms. It will also ask for the constants, which are the numbers not attached to an x. With this information, the solver can find the roots, or solutions, to the equation. The roots tell where the line intersects the x-axis on a graph. There are two roots because there are two values of x that make the equation true. To find these roots, the solver will use one of several methods, such as factoring or completing the square. Each method has its own set of steps, but all require some algebraic manipulation. The binomial solver can help take care of these steps so that you can focus on understanding the concept behind solving quadratic equations.\n\nBasic mathematics is the study of mathematical operations and their properties. The focus of this branch of mathematics is on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are the foundation for all other types of math, including algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. In addition to studying how these operations work, students also learn how to solve equations and how to use basic concepts of geometry and trigonometry. Basic mathematics is an essential part of every student's education, and it provides a strong foundation for further study in math."}
